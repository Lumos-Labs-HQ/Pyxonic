# Pyxonic 🌟  
**A revolutionary framework for app developers to write both frontend and backend code in Python.**  

> Pyxonic lets you build stunning apps effortlessly by combining frontend and backend logic in one framework. Write frontend with `.pyx` files and backend with `.py` files, using FastAPI for server-side development. 🚀  
---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Unified Frontend & Backend**: Write everything in Python.  
- **File-Based Routing**: Auto-map routes from file structure.  
- **FastAPI Backend**: Built-in support for scalable APIs.  
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Access device-level features like native apps.  
- **Cross-Platform**: Build apps for web, mobile, or desktop.

## 🖋 Writing the Frontend  

In Pyxonic, frontend code is written in `.pyx` files. Here's an example:  

### Example `.pyx` File  

pyx  
<Screen>  
    <Text>Hello, {{ username }}!</Text>  
    <Button onClick="open_profile()">Go to Profile</Button>  
</Screen>  

def open_profile():  
    navigate("/profile")  


### Output (Transpiled)  
Pyxonic will automatically transpile your `.pyx` code into platform-specific code. For example:  

#### For Web:  
html  
<div>  
    <p>Hello, {{ username }}!</p>  
    <button onclick="open_profile()">Go to Profile</button>  
</div>  
<script>  
function open_profile() {  
    window.location.href = "/profile";  
}  
</script>  


#### For Android (Kotlin XML):  
xml  
```
<LinearLayout>  
    <TextView android:text="Hello, {{ username }}!" />  
    <Button android:onClick="open_profile" android:text="Go to Profile" />  
</LinearLayout>  
```

## 🌐 Writing the Backend  

Backend code is written in `.py` files using FastAPI. Here's an example:  

### Example `.py` File  

python  
from fastapi import FastAPI  

app = FastAPI()  

@app.post("/api/login")  
def login(username: str, password: str):  
    return {"status": "success", "user": username}  


---

## 📖 File-Based Routing  

In Pyxonic, routing is automatically generated based on your file structure. Here's how it works:  
- `/pages/index.pyx` → `/`  
- `/pages/profile.pyx` → `/profile`  
- `/api/auth.py` → `/api/auth`  

This file-based routing eliminates the need for manual route configuration, simplifying the development process.
